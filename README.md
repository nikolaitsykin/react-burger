Project  "Stellar Burger" project application was written with the following technology stack: TypeScript, React, Redux, Redux-Toolkit, Websockets, React-dnd, testing - Jest and Cypress.

Deployment: 
## https://nikolaitsykin.github.io/react-burger/

This project is in Russian localization because of APIs I used, but Google translate can easily do the trick.

All starts with a 404 page because otherwise, you won't see it on github pages(routing is not working correctly). Press the button in the middle or use navigation bar in the Header.
